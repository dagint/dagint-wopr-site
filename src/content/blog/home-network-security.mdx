Your home network is the gateway for all your devices. Here’s a short checklist to make it more secure.

## Router and Wi‑Fi

1. **Change the default admin password** on your router. Default logins are easy to look up and are a common entry point for attackers.
2. **Use WPA3** if your router supports it; otherwise use **WPA2** with a strong passphrase (long, random, or a passphrase you can remember but others can’t guess).
3. **Rename your Wi‑Fi network (SSID)** to something that doesn’t identify you or your address. You can hide the SSID for a bit of obscurity, but don’t rely on it as your only security.
4. **Enable the firewall** on the router if it’s not on by default.
5. **Turn on automatic firmware updates** if the option exists, or check the manufacturer’s site periodically for updates.

## Guest network

Use a **guest network** for visitors and smart home devices. That way they’re separated from your main LAN and your computers and phones. Use a different, strong password for the guest network too.

## Devices on the network

- **Keep everything updated**: PCs, phones, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices. Many breaches happen through outdated software.
- **Disable features you don’t use** (e.g. remote management on the router, unused ports).
- **Give IoT devices minimal access**: put them on the guest network or a separate VLAN if you have that option.

## What to do if something seems wrong

If your internet is slow for no reason, you see unknown devices in the router admin, or your browser or antivirus warns you about something, disconnect the suspicious device from Wi‑Fi and change your Wi‑Fi password. Then update the router firmware and scan your main devices for malware.
