Robot lawn mowers can save a lot of time, but not every model fits every yard. Here’s what to think about before you buy.

## Lawn size and shape

- **Map your lawn area** (in square meters or square feet). Manufacturers rate mowers by max lawn size; stay within that range for best results.
- **Complex shapes** (lots of curves, islands, narrow strips) may need a boundary wire and careful setup. Some models handle odd layouts better than others.
- **Slopes**: Check the maximum slope rating (e.g. 25–45%). Steep hills need a model built for it, or the robot can slip or miss spots.

## Boundary and navigation

- **Boundary wire**: Most robots use a perimeter wire you bury or peg down. Plan where it will go and how you’ll run it (under paths, around beds).
- **GPS / no-wire**: A few high-end models use GPS or other “wire-free” methods. They can be easier to install but check reviews for your yard type and climate.
- **Obstacles**: Decide how the robot will handle trees, beds, and paths (wire vs. sensors). Some units need a clear strip; others can get closer.

## Battery and runtime

- **Runtime per charge** and **charging time** determine how much the robot can mow in one day. Bigger lawns may need a bigger battery or longer daily schedule.
- **Mulching**: Most robot mowers mulch (fine clippings, no bag). That’s usually best for the lawn; just set height and frequency so it’s not cutting too much at once.

## Smart features and connectivity

- **App control**: Schedules, zones, and status are easier with a good app. Check that the app works well and is supported in your region.
- **Rain sensor**: Many models pause in rain. Useful so the robot isn’t running on wet grass or in storms.
- **Theft protection**: PIN, alarms, or GPS can help; consider your neighborhood and storage location.

## Price vs. needs

- **Entry-level**: Fine for small, simple lawns. Fewer features, often still reliable.
- **Mid-range**: Better navigation, app, and slope handling for most suburban yards.
- **High-end**: Big lawns, tough terrain, or “no wire” setups. Only worth it if your yard actually needs it.
