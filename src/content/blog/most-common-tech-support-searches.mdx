When something breaks or feels wrong, most of us turn to search first. Here are the tech support topics people look up most often, plus simple steps you can try before calling in the pros.

## “My computer is slow”

- **Startup**: Turn off programs you don’t need at login (Settings → Apps → Startup, or Task Manager → Startup). Fewer items = faster boot and less background load.
- **Storage**: Run Disk Cleanup, turn on Storage Sense, and remove old downloads and unused apps. A drive that’s over 90% full can slow everything down.
- **Updates**: Install Windows (or Mac) updates and restart. Pending updates and old drivers often cause slowness.
- **Malware**: Run a full scan with Windows Defender or your chosen antivirus. Infections are a common cause of sudden slowdowns.

If it’s still slow after these steps, it may be time for a tune-up, more RAM, or a faster drive. [Get in touch](/contact) for a diagnostic.

## “Wi‑Fi not working” / “No internet”

- **Router**: Power-cycle the router and modem (unplug 30 seconds, plug back in). Wait a few minutes and test again.
- **Device**: Turn Wi‑Fi off and on, forget the network and reconnect, or restart the device.
- **Cable**: If you use Ethernet, check the cable and try another port on the router.
- **Other devices**: If only one device has no internet, the issue is likely that device or its connection. If everything is down, focus on the router, modem, or ISP.

For ongoing dropouts or weak signal, we can help with placement, a mesh system, or checking your router settings.

## “Forgot my password”

- **Windows**: Use “I forgot my password” on the sign-in screen (with a linked email or phone). For a local account, you may need a password reset disk or recovery options you set up earlier.
- **Microsoft / Google / Apple**: Use the account recovery flow on the vendor’s site (e.g. account.microsoft.com, accounts.google.com). Have access to your recovery email or phone.
- **Router**: Look for a small reset button; hold it with a paperclip for ~10 seconds. This restores factory defaults and wipes your Wi‑Fi password and settings, so you’ll need to set them up again.

We can guide you through recovery or, for local Windows accounts, help with reset options if you’re stuck.

## “Computer won’t turn on”

- **Power**: Confirm the cable is firmly in the PC and the wall (or surge strip). Try another outlet or bypass the strip.
- **Laptop**: Remove the charger, hold the power button 15–20 seconds, then plug back in and try again. If the battery is removable, reseat it.
- **Lights / fans**: If nothing at all happens, it’s often power supply, cable, or motherboard. If lights or fans briefly come on then stop, it can be RAM, overheating, or a failing component.

For no response at all or repeated failure to boot, a professional check is wise to avoid damaging parts.

## “How to back up my computer”

- **Windows**: Use **Settings → Accounts → Windows backup** (OneDrive and settings), and **Settings → System → Storage → Backup options** for File History to an external drive.
- **Mac**: Turn on Time Machine and connect an external drive (or use a Time Capsule / network volume).
- **Rule of thumb**: Keep at least one copy off the machine (external drive or cloud). Test a restore once so you know it works.

We can set up automated backups and show you how to restore files when you need them.

## “Virus” / “Malware” / “Pop-ups”

- **Scan**: Run a full scan with Windows Security (Defender) or your installed antivirus. Remove anything it finds and restart.
- **Browser**: Clear cache and cookies, disable suspicious extensions, and reset the browser to defaults if it’s hijacked. Avoid “fix my PC” pop-ups—they’re often scams.
- **Prevention**: Keep Windows and your browser updated, don’t open attachments or links from unknown senders, and avoid pirated software.

If you’re unsure whether something is safe or the machine still acts oddly after a scan, [contact us](/contact) for a clean-up and security check.
