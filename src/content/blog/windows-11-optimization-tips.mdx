Whether you've just upgraded or have been on Windows 11 for a while, a few tweaks can make your PC feel faster and more responsive.

## Speed up startup

- Open **Settings → Apps → Startup** and disable programs you don't need at login. Fewer startup items mean a quicker boot and less background load.
- Use **Task Manager → Startup** to see impact; turn off high-impact items you rarely use.

## Free up space and keep things tidy

- **Storage Sense**: Settings → System → Storage → turn on Storage Sense so Windows can auto-delete temp files and recycle bin content.
- Run **Disk Cleanup** (cleanmgr) occasionally and remove old Windows update files if you're comfortable.
- Uninstall unused apps from Settings → Apps → Installed apps.

## Reduce visual effects (for older or low-spec PCs)

- **Settings → Accessibility → Visual effects** — turn off transparency and animations if you prefer speed over eye candy.
- In **System → About → Advanced system settings → Performance**, choose “Adjust for best performance” or hand-pick only the effects you want.

## Privacy and background apps

- **Settings → Privacy & security** — review app permissions and turn off background app access for apps that don’t need it.
- Limiting background activity can improve both performance and battery life on laptops.

## Keep it updated

- Allow Windows Update to run (or schedule active hours so it doesn’t interrupt you). Security and driver updates often include performance fixes.

If your PC still feels slow after these steps, it may be time for a hardware check or a clean reinstall. [Contact DaGint](/contact) for a tune-up or diagnostic.
