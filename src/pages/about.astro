      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        We prioritize repairing and extending the life of existing equipment over unnecessary replacements, reducing electronic waste and helping our clients save money. When upgrades are necessary, we help responsibly recycle old hardware and ensure data is securely wiped before disposal.

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Our remote support capabilities minimize travel, reducing our carbon footprint while providing faster, more convenient service. We also work with clients to optimize their systems for energy efficiency, helping reduce power consumption and operational costs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Sustainability isn't just good for the planet—it's good business. By helping you get the most out of your technology investments, we're building a more sustainable future together.
